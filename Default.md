### Introduction

### What is Singularity/Apptainer?

> \"Apptainer/Singularity is the most widely used container system for HPC.
> It is designed to execute applications at bare-metal performance
> while being secure, portable, and 100% reproducible.\"^[1](#footnote1){#ref1}^

[Back in November 2021](http://apptainer.org/news/community-announcement-20211130), the Singularity project has forked into a commercial offer
with a community version from [the Sylabs company](https://sylabs.io/), which kept the Singularity name,
and a fully open-source project now named [Apptainer](http://apptainer.org) under the Linux Foundation.

As of May 2022, Expanse currently offers SingularityPRO from Sylabs, it is possible that in the future it will be supporting both platforms. Use `module avail <search string>` on your terminal on Expanse to check the most up-to-date availability.
